        <p> <i>The program teaches the basics of computer programming and networking, comprises a plethora of course contents. They study programming languages, program design, computation, design and development of algorithms, computer software and hardware.</i></p>
        Academic programs vary between colleges. Undergraduate Courses usually include programming, algorithms and data structures, computer architecture, operating systems, computer networks, parallel computing, embedded systems, algorithms design, circuit analysis and electronics, digital logic and processor design, computer graphics, scientific computing, software engineering, database systems, digital signal processing, virtualization, computer simulations and games programming. CSE programs also include core subjects of theoretical computer science such as theory of computation, numerical methods, machine learning, programming theory and paradigms. Modern academic programs also cover emerging computing fields like image processing, data science, robotics, bio-inspired computing, computational biology, autonomic computing and artificial intelligence. Most of the above CSE areas require initial mathematical knowledge, hence the first year of study is dominated by mathematical courses, primarily discrete mathematics, mathematical analysis, linear algebra, Probability, and statistics, as well as the basics of Electrical and electronic engineering, physics - field theory, and electromagnetism.

        <p> <i>Civil engineering is the professional practice of designing and developing infrastructure projects. This can be on a huge scale, such as the development of nationwide transport systems or water supply networks, or on a smaller scale, such as the development of individual roads or buildings.</i></p>
        Civil engineers typically possess an academic degree in civil engineering. The length of study is three to five years, and the completed degree is designated as a bachelor of technology, or a bachelor of engineering. The curriculum generally includes classes in physics, mathematics, project management, design and specific topics in civil engineering. After taking basic courses in most sub-disciplines of civil engineering, they move on to specialize in one or more sub-disciplines at advanced levels. While an undergraduate degree (BEng/BSc) normally provides successful students with industry-accredited qualification, some academic institutions offer post-graduate degrees (MEng/MSc), which allow students to further specialize in their particular area of interest.

        <p> <i>Electrical Engineering is that branch of Engineering which deals with the study of application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism. Trained electrical engineers design electric circuits and equipment.</i></p>
       Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design and application of equipment, devices and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution and use.

        Electrical engineering is now divided into a wide range of different fields, including computer engineering, systems engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, radio-frequency engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, photovoltaic cells, electronics, and optics and photonics. Many of these disciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations including hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics and waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics/control, and electrical materials science.

        <p> <i>The Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) program prepares you for a wide range of engineering study and career options, including business, biomedical engineering, computer hardware, the aerospace industry, computer software, nanoelectronic chips, photonics, nanoengineering, robotics and solar energy harvesting and distribution.</i></p>
        Engineers make the world a better place; they take a fuzzy idea and turn it into something real. They use math and science to solve problems and create new products and services. As an electrical and computer engineer you will work at the heart of the most rapidly developing technology humankind has ever seen. Youâ€™ll employ nanoelectronics, computers and new photonic crystals to create biomedical instruments that save lives and new robotic systems that can search disaster sites or remotely explore other planets. You will make devices and systems that harvest the energy of the sun, wind and sea and channel it into the energy grid that supports modern civilization.
